The company's market share in the electric two-wheeler segment subsequently halved in August.

Production cut of Chetak electric scooter: AnAl Jazeeraarticle, published on August 28, detailed how a global shortage of rare-earth metals forced Bajaj Auto to significantly reduce the production of its Chetak electric scooter. The article states that Bajaj produced just 10,824 Chetak units in July, nearly halving its output compared to the 20,384 units made in the same period last year.

Impact on market share: This production issue contributed to a considerable drop in Bajaj Auto's electric vehicle (EV) market share. A report published later, on September 1, indicates that the company's EV market share declined from 22% in July to 11% in August, moving it to the fifth spot in the segment. The report also mentions that rival Ather Energy saw a market share increase during the same period.

Analysts' commentary on GST: A report from Jefferies on August 28 included commentary on the potential impact of a possible Goods and Services Tax (GST) reduction on the automotive sector. While the report did not focus specifically on Bajaj Auto, it noted that two-wheelers and small passenger vehicles would likely benefit most from such a cut."

Global emerging markets (EM) fund ownership

HDFC Bank allotted 767.7 crore bonus shares in a 1:1 ratio to eligible shareholders, effectively doubling the bank's equity base.

The record date for determining eligible shareholders was August 27, 2025.

Following the allotment, the bank's paid-up share capital increased to ₹1,535.4 crore.

This was the first bonus issue in the bank's history and is seen as an indicator of management's confidence in liquidity and trading volumes.

According to a Copley Fund Research analysis, HDFC Bank has cemented its position as the most important emerging market bank in global portfolios.

It is now held by 71% of all actively managed EM funds, the highest representation in the research firm's 17-year history.

This is attributed to the bank's increased strategic significance following its 2023 merger with its parent company, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC)."
