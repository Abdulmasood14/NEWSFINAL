Stock Performance on August 26, 2025 Eicher Motors Ltd. Stock Performance on August 26, 2025

On August 26, 2025, Eicher Motors Ltd. stock demonstrated strong performance, reaching a new 52-week high of ₹6,203.15 and closing at ₹6,151.00, a gain of 2.68%. This performance occurred amidst a broader market decline, where the BSE Sensex fell by 1.04% and the Nifty50 by 1.02%.

Key Factors Driving Stock Performance:

Corporate Developments (July 31, 2025):

Impact of GST Rate Cut Expectations:

Note: While Eicher Motors stock performed well on August 26, 2025, and announced its Q1FY26 results on July 31, 2025, no other significant corporate developments or business updates were reported on August 26, 2025.

Positive Market Sentiment:Despite the overall market decline, Eicher Motors stock benefitted from positive sentiment in the two-wheeler sector.

Strong Q1FY26 Results:The company's robust Q1FY26 financial performance, announced on August 1, 2025, likely contributed to investor confidence. Revenue from operations stood at ₹5,042 crore, up 14.8% YoY, and profit after tax was ₹1,205 crore, up 9.4% YoY.

Potential GST Rate Cut:Expectations of a potential GST rate cut for automobiles in September 2025 may have also positively influenced investor sentiment in the auto sector.

Dividend Announcement:The announcement of a final dividend of ₹70 per share on August 1, 2025, with an ex-date of August 26, 2025, could have attracted investors.

Q1FY26 Financial Results:Eicher Motors announced its Q1FY26 results, reporting a 9.4% YoY increase in profit after tax to ₹1,205 crore and a 14.8% YoY increase in revenue from operations to ₹5,042 crore.

Dividend Declaration:A final dividend of ₹70 per share was declared, with the ex-date set as August 26, 2025.

Indian auto sales slowed in August 2025 as buyers postponed purchases, anticipating a possible GST rate cut in September 2025.

Jefferies expected two-wheelers and small passenger vehicle manufacturers to be the biggest beneficiaries of the potential GST rate cut."

Key corporate developments on August 26, 2025:

Bonus share trading: HDFC Bank shares traded ex-bonus for the first time in its history, following a 1:1 bonus share issue. This meant that eligible shareholders received one additional share for each share they owned.

Share price adjustment: In a technical market adjustment, the stock's price was reduced to reflect the doubling of outstanding shares, which led to headlines about a significant dip in the stock price. For example, news reports clarified that the apparent 50% drop was not due to a financial loss but was a direct result of this corporate action.

Record date for bonus shares: August 26, 2025, also served as the record date for determining shareholders eligible for the bonus issue, since the official record date of August 27 was a market holiday."
