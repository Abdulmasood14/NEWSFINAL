In a Q1 FY26 earnings call, Axis Bank management explained that a technical, rather than fundamental, reclassification of certain retail accounts led to higher-than-usual reported slippages.

Exclusion of Routine Information

Routine market commentary, price movements, and other non-material information such as the schedule of analyst/investor meets or newspaper publications regarding the postal ballot for CEO appointment have been excluded from this summary.

Resilience Amidst Market Weakness:On August 27, 2025, the Nifty slipped below 24,800 due to banking sector weakness, raising concerns about a further potential decline towards 24,600. However, according toThe Economic TimesandTaxTMI, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), along with other FMCG and auto stocks such as Maruti and Britannia, demonstrated resilience and outperformed the broader market. This suggests HUL's relative strength as a defensive stock during market consolidation and negative sentiment.

Impact of US Tariff Implementation:According to TaxTMI, a US government draft order proposing an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, including HUL products, came into effect on August 27, 2025. This tariff was linked to national-security-related concerns and prompted immediate market disruption. The notice explained that the higher levies were linked to ""threats to the US by the government of the Russian Federation,"" with India targeted in line with that strategy.

Concerns over Market Impact:According to The Economic Times, market sentiment on August 27, 2025, remained fragile, with large-cap stocks like HUL declining and mid and small-cap stocks underperforming. This downturn was triggered by the US imposing a 50% tariff on Indian goods and continuous foreign fund outflows.  According toUpstox, market investors became poorer by â‚¹11.21 lakh crore in three days (August 26, 28, and 29) of selling pressure, where the benchmark SENSEX tumbled 1,826 points. The market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms eroded by â‚¹11,21,459.36 crore to â‚¹4,43,65,504.09 crore ($5.05 trillion) in three days.

News reports from that day focused on market commentary, including expert analysis on market valuations and the impact of US tariffs on Indian equities, rather than specific corporate news from Infosys.

However, there were significant announcements related to Infosys in the days immediately surrounding August 27, 2025:

August 28, 2025: Infosys announced a strategic collaboration with Mastercard to scale cross-border payments by integrating Mastercard's payment capabilities into the Infosys Finacle platform.

August 25, 2025: Multiple news outlets reported that brokerage firms Investec and JP Morgan upgraded their ratings on Infosys, leading to a rise in the stock price. The upgrades were based on expectations of a market recovery driven by AI and robust deal pipelines in the second half of fiscal year 2026."

One news snippet from August 28, 2025, mentions that L&T was included in a list of ""High Conviction Stock Picks Aug 2025"" and highlights its strong domestic and international order pipeline, as well as new growth drivers in green energy, data centers, and semiconductors.

Milestone for pre-owned car business On August 27, 2025, the company's pre-owned car division, Maruti Suzuki True Value, celebrated crossing the 60 lakh (6 million) sales milestone. The news highlighted the brand's growth and noted a growing customer trust in India's pre-owned car market.

However, the substantial coverage on August 27 confirms that these were key developments discussed by the news media on that date. For example, Maruti's press release on August 26 covered the e-Vitara's production and the battery milestone, with financial outlets like Business Today and Swarajyamag publishing detailed reports on the 27th.

Maruti Suzuki, through its parent company Suzuki, will invest approximately â‚¹70,000 crore ($8 billion) in India over the next 5â€“6 years.

The investment will help increase Maruti Suzuki's overall production capacity from 2 million to 4 million units annually.

The Hansalpur facility in Gujarat will become the production hub for Suzuki's global EV manufacturing, with exports planned to 100 countries.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the production of Maruti's first battery electric vehicle (BEV), the e-Vitara, which will be exported to Europe and other countries.

Other than this, no significant corporate developments specific to SBIN Ltd were reported on that date.

Key points from the SBI Research report:

Note: The search results indicate that August 27, 2025, was also a stock market holiday in India for Ganesh Chaturthi, which is not a corporate development for SBIN.

The US increased tariffs on Indian goods to 50%.

The report stated that if the tariffs persisted, India's trade surplus could potentially convert into a trade deficit.

Sectors like textiles and gems and jewellery were expected to be pressured, while pharmaceuticals, steel, and smartphones were less likely to be impacted.

The report concluded that trade negotiations would likely restore confidence and help improve exports to the US."

August 26, 2025:A number of news reports discussed a stock price drop for Sun Pharma and other Indian pharmaceutical companies. This followed an announcement by US President Donald Trump about his intent to slash drug prices and impose tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals.

August 27, 2025:Additional tariffs of 25% on Indian goods came into effect in the US, contributing to a negative market sentiment that affected the stock prices of Indian pharma companies, including Sun Pharma.

August 28, 2025:News reports confirmed that while the broader tariff increase took effect, Indian pharmaceuticals were ultimately excluded from the 50% tariff, a factor that was influencing the market. The market commentary on this day was related to the stock movement and the tariff situation rather than a specific corporate action by Sun Pharma."

Disclaimer: While Simply Wall St. is a reputable source, it's important to consider various factors and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

Slowing Rates of Return:An analysis by Simply Wall St. on August 27, 2025, highlighted concerns about slowing returns on capital employed (ROCE) at Tata Consumer Products. The analysis pointed out that while the company has increased its capital employed by 58% over the past five years, the returns on this capital have remained stable at 6.9%. This ROCE underperforms the Food industry average of 13% and raises questions about the company's ability to generate high returns on its investments."

Demerger approval: The NCLT's sanction of the Composite Scheme of Arrangement, originally ordered on August 25, became a focus of market discussion on August 27. The scheme permits the demerger of the commercial vehicle (CV) business into TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd. and the merger of the passenger vehicle (PV) and electric vehicle (EV) businesses into a separate entity.

Future listing plans: Following the demerger, the two entities are expected to be listed separately in the third quarter of the 2026 financial year.

Demerger ratio: The approved demerger plan confirms a 1:1 share-split ratio, meaning existing shareholders will receive one share of the new company for each share of Tata Motors they own."
