  "extracted_text": "On August 25, 2025, Axis Bank Managing Director and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry stated that banks are not compensated for their Unified Payment Interface (UPI) infrastructure, which has reduced bank income . Speaking at the FIBAC 2025 conference, he added that while a subsidy had previously been provided, it was reduced, and overall income growth has been subdued because charges have been kept at a minimum by regulators.\n\nThis was the most substantial corporate development reported for Axis Bank on that date. Other search results from August 25, 2025, primarily discuss routine market commentary, share price movements, and trading activity, which fall outside the scope of significant corporate developments.",
