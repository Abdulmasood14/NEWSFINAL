This was a direct result of the bank's recently announced 1:1 bonus share issue.\n\nKey corporate developments on August 26, 2025:\n\nBonus share trading: HDFC Bank shares traded ex-bonus for the first time in its history, following a 1:1 bonus share issue. This meant that eligible shareholders received one additional share for each share they owned.\n\nShare price adjustment: In a technical market adjustment, the stock's price was reduced to reflect the doubling of outstanding shares, which led to headlines about a significant dip in the stock price. For example, news reports clarified that the apparent 50% drop was not due to a financial loss but was a direct result of this corporate action.\n\nRecord date for bonus shares: August 26, 2025, also served as the record date for determining shareholders eligible for the bonus issue, since the official record date of August 27 was a market holiday.",
