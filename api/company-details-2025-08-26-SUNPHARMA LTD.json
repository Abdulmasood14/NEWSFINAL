  "extracted_text": "On August 26, 2025, Bank of America Securities downgraded its rating for SUNPHARMA Ltd from \"Neutral\" to \"Underperform,\" citing risks to premium valuations and execution challenges with specialty drugs .\n\nReasons for downgrade:The brokerage cited risks to consensus earnings and concerns about stretched valuations.\n\nSpecialty drug issues:Analysts believe the revenue ramp-up for recently launched specialty drugs will be more gradual than initially expected.\n\nTarget price cut:Bank of America lowered its price target for Sun Pharma from ₹1,730 to ₹1,570.\n\nIlumya overhang:Concerns were noted about the company's psoriasis drug, Ilumya, particularly its heavy exposure to Medicare, potential pricing pressures, and limited earnings visibility.\n\nUS government action:The downgrade was partially influenced by broader sector concerns, including reports of a potential 25% tariff on Indian goods, including pharmaceuticals, by the US government.\n\nOverall market context:Sun Pharma's share price decline was also placed within the context of a wider market slump for Indian pharma stocks, which faced pressure following US tariff discussions.",
