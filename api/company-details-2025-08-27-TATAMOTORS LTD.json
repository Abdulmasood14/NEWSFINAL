  "extracted_text": "Significant corporate news for Tata Motors Ltd. on August 27, 2025, involved the approval of its major restructuring plan by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) . This allows the company to demerge its commercial vehicle business and merge the passenger vehicle business into two separate listed entities.\n\nDemerger approval: The NCLT's sanction of the Composite Scheme of Arrangement, originally ordered on August 25, became a focus of market discussion on August 27. The scheme permits the demerger of the commercial vehicle (CV) business into TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd. and the merger of the passenger vehicle (PV) and electric vehicle (EV) businesses into a separate entity.\n\nFuture listing plans: Following the demerger, the two entities are expected to be listed separately in the third quarter of the 2026 financial year.\n\nDemerger ratio: The approved demerger plan confirms a 1:1 share-split ratio, meaning existing shareholders will receive one share of the new company for each share of Tata Motors they own.",
