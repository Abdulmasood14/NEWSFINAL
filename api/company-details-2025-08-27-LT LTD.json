  "extracted_text": "Based on the search results, there were no direct news articles or announcements published on August 27, 2025, specifically detailing substantial corporate developments or business updates for LT Ltd.\n\nHowever, several search results published around that date mention LT Ltd in the context of broader market analysis, investment recommendations, and the impact of the newly implemented US tariffs on Indian exports.\n\nOne news snippet from August 28, 2025, mentions that L&T was included in a list of \"High Conviction Stock Picks Aug 2025\" and highlights its strong domestic and international order pipeline, as well as new growth drivers in green energy, data centers, and semiconductors. Another snippet from August 29, 2025, notes that Larsen & Toubro shares gained 0.99% in intraday trade . Additionally, a Business Standard article published on August 25, 2025 reported that L&T was looking to build on its defense and data center foundation in India, scaling up its â‚¹2,200 crore data center play and expanding its defense and aerospace businesses.\n\nIt's important to note that many of these articles are focused on market trends and the impact of external factors like tariffs rather than specific corporate announcements made by LT Ltd on that particular day. Several articles from around this period also mention the general sentiment of Indian firms delaying expansion plans due to demand and trade uncertainty. Therefore, while there was general news mentioning LT Ltd in the context of the wider economic and market landscape, there is no evidence of a direct, substantial corporate development announcement from the company itself on August 27, 2025.",
