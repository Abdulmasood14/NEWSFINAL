  "extracted_text": "On August 28, 2025, Jefferies upgraded HEROMOTOCO Ltd. to a \"Hold\" rating from \"Underperform,\" forecasting increased demand for two-wheelers due to a potential Goods and Services Tax (GST) cut . While this is primarily market commentary based on an external factor, it is a noteworthy event since it reflects a significant change in an analyst's view regarding the company's future earnings.\n\nThe brokerage raised its price target for Hero MotoCorp to Rs 5,200 from Rs 3,800.\n\nJefferies stated that a GST reduction would benefit two-wheelers and small passenger vehicles most significantly.\n\nThe upgrade was tempered by ongoing concerns about Hero MotoCorp's declining market share.",
