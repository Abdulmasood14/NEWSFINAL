This was a substantial corporate development with several significant facets:\n\nProduction and export plans: The made-in-India e-Vitara will be sold domestically and exported to over 100 countries, including European nations and Japan. The company aims to become India's largest electric carmaker in its first year in the EV market.\n\nExpansion of EV ecosystem: To support the new EV, a new assembly line was commissioned with an investment of ₹2,000 crore. Additionally, a new lithium-ion battery plant in Hansalpur—a joint venture with Toshiba and Denso—began local production of hybrid battery electrodes, supporting the company's hybrid and EV plans.\n\nStrategic investment: Parent company Suzuki Motor Corporation announced plans to invest ₹70,000 crore in India over the next five to six years to strengthen its advanced automotive and green mobility manufacturing.\n\nGovernment involvement: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the event to flag off the first e-Vitara, endorsing the project as a major step for the \"Make in India\" initiative and the country's green mobility goals.",
