Subrahmanyan, stated that private capital expenditure is now a substantial part of the company's order book. He highlighted a strategic focus on growth through record orders, rising private capex, aiming for a $100 billion valuation, global projects, and expanding services, technology, and financial businesses.\n\nSubrahmanyan also noted that the Indian government's decision to rationalize Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a positive development for L&T. He emphasized that private investment is returning strongly, which is a positive shift from the pandemic period when orders were largely driven by government and multilateral projects.",
