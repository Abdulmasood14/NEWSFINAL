However, according toThe Economic TimesandTaxTMI, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), along with other FMCG and auto stocks such as Maruti and Britannia, demonstrated resilience and outperformed the broader market. This suggests HUL's relative strength as a defensive stock during market consolidation and negative sentiment.\n\nImpact of US Tariff Implementation:According to TaxTMI, a US government draft order proposing an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, including HUL products, came into effect on August 27, 2025. This tariff was linked to national-security-related concerns and prompted immediate market disruption. The notice explained that the higher levies were linked to \"threats to the US by the government of the Russian Federation,\" with India targeted in line with that strategy.\n\nConcerns over Market Impact:According to The Economic Times, market sentiment on August 27, 2025, remained fragile, with large-cap stocks like HUL declining and mid and small-cap stocks underperforming. This downturn was triggered by the US imposing a 50% tariff on Indian goods and continuous foreign fund outflows.  According toUpstox, market investors became poorer by ₹11.21 lakh crore in three days (August 26, 28, and 29) of selling pressure, where the benchmark SENSEX tumbled 1,826 points. The market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms eroded by ₹11,21,459.36 crore to ₹4,43,65,504.09 crore ($5.05 trillion) in three days.\n\nConcerns over Market Impact:According to The Economic Times, market sentiment on August 27, 2025, remained fragile, with large-cap stocks like HUL declining and mid and small-cap stocks underperforming.
