The news of this approval was widely reported on August 26, 2025.\n\nDemerger plan: The NCLT's sanction clears the way for the company to split into two separate publicly listed entities:\n\nCommercial vehicle business: This division, including related investments, will be demerged into TML Commercial Vehicles Ltd..\n\nPassenger vehicle business: This segment, which includes the EV arm and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), will be consolidated under Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd..\n\nStrategic rationale: The demerger is intended to create a more focused and streamlined corporate structure, which the company expects will enhance operational efficiency and drive long-term growth for both segments. The plan had received approval from the company's board and shareholders in March 2024.",
