The partnership will provide retail car financing to VinFast customers through the bank's dealer network. The agreement is intended to make EV ownership more accessible for Indian consumers by providing tailored financing solutions, which may include attractive interest rates, flexible repayment options, and on-site support from SBI representatives at VinFast showrooms.\n\nAlso on August 25, 2025, SBI's Chairperson, Challa Sreenivasulu Setty, announced at an industry event that the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) would formally ask the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow banks to fund mergers and acquisitions (M&A) of listed companies. Currently, banks are barred from such lending, forcing companies to seek funding from other sources. According to Setty, the proposal is to start with publicly listed companies where acquisitions are more transparent and shareholder-approved.",
