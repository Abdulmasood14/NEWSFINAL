This approach is intended to speed up delivery and win more deals, particularly in a market with fewer \"eye-popping\" mega-deals.\n\nInternal reorganization: Infosys has changed its internal structure to allow employees to work on projects outside their traditional business units. This change will allow for more flexible deployment of talent based on matching skills to project requirements across different sectors, such as manufacturing or high-tech.\n\nUniting Financial Services deal: The Finacle suite was selected by Uniting Financial Services to migrate its operations entirely to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud.\n\nStrategic importance: This deal is highlighted as a strengthening of Finacle's position in providing next-generation digital banking solutions and was cited as a driver for Infosys's stock rally on that day.\n\nRating upgrade: Investec and JP Morgan upgraded their ratings for Infosys, setting higher target prices and leading to a jump in its share price.\n\nMarket performance: The news came on a day when the broader IT market was experiencing a rally, buoyed by signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve about a possible interest rate cut.",
