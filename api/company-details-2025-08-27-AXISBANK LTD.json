Management stated that the new norms would have a minimal economic impact going forward.\n\nKey details from the announcement:\n\nIn a Q1 FY26 earnings call, Axis Bank management explained that a technical, rather than fundamental, reclassification of certain retail accounts led to higher-than-usual reported slippages.\n\nDespite this, the bank stated it is well-positioned for faster-than-industry growth from fiscal year 2026, supported by a strong balance sheet and stabilizing retail stress.\n\nManagement also noted that margins are expected to widen over the medium term.",
