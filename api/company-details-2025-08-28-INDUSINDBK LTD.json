  "extracted_text": "On August 28, 2025, IndusInd Bank's shareholders rejected a proposal that would have allowed promoters to nominate an additional director to the board . The news of this vote, which took place during the bank's Annual General Meeting (AGM) on that day, was widely reported by news outlets. The rejected resolution was voted down by 54% of shareholders, despite having received prior approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n\nPromoter institution IndusInd International Holdings (IIHL) expressed disappointment with the vote, stating they would work to clear up what they called a \"misinterpretation\" by proxy advisors. While this resolution failed, shareholders did approve the appointment of Rajiv Anand as the new MD and CEO, and other resolutions were also passed.\n\nContextual information This development follows other corporate changes and news earlier in August, including:\n\nCEO change:Rajiv Anand had already formally taken charge as the new Managing Director and CEO on August 25, 2025, following his earlier appointment by the RBI.\n\nAGM announcement:The 31st Annual General Meeting was scheduled for August 29, 2025.\n\nQ1 results:Earlier in July, the bank reported a decline in Q1 FY26 net profit and faced scrutiny over asset quality.",
