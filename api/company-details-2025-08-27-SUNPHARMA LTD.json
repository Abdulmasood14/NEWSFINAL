  "extracted_text": "No significant corporate developments for SUNPHARMA Ltd on August 27, 2025 . News on that date focused on the stock market's response to the US imposing tariffs on India, which began on August 27, 2025.\n\nHere is a summary of the events surrounding that date:\n\nAugust 26, 2025:A number of news reports discussed a stock price drop for Sun Pharma and other Indian pharmaceutical companies. This followed an announcement by US President Donald Trump about his intent to slash drug prices and impose tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals.\n\nAugust 27, 2025:Additional tariffs of 25% on Indian goods came into effect in the US, contributing to a negative market sentiment that affected the stock prices of Indian pharma companies, including Sun Pharma.\n\nAugust 28, 2025:News reports confirmed that while the broader tariff increase took effect, Indian pharmaceuticals were ultimately excluded from the 50% tariff, a factor that was influencing the market. The market commentary on this day was related to the stock movement and the tariff situation rather than a specific corporate action by Sun Pharma.",
